# WordSearchEngine
Repository for implementing a word search in files engine

This solution has been created with Visual Studio 2019.
For running the program, just download the code and compile it. If you want to run it pressing F5, you will have to provide a folder name as an argument.
For running once compiled as a console program, just open a command line prompt, go to the folder containing the executable and run it with a valid folder name as an argument.

This program assumes that the directory contains ONLY text files, because I haven't spent time handling input errors.
